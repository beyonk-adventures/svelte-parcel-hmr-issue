# Svelte seed

A ready to go, live-reloading seed project for svelte.

Uses parceljs for bundling.

Just edit the files in `src/components` to get started.

## Preparation

```bash
npm install
```

## How to run

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Developing

Edit the `component.html` file and run `npm run watch`

## Building for production

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

and your built asset will exist in `/dist/<hash>.js`.

## Deploying

The seed has no built-in functionality for deployment, but recommends installing [now](https://zeit.co/now):

```bash
npm i -g now
```

and using their zero config deployments to get started!

```bash
now
```
